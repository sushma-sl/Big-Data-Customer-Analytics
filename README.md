# Big Data Pipeline for Real-Time Customer Analytics

## Overview
This project involved the design and implementation of a **real-time Big Data pipeline** to analyze customer behavior data across digital platforms for a leading e-commerce company. The pipeline was designed to handle **high velocity, variety, and volume** of data while delivering actionable insights to optimize customer experience, improve marketing strategies, and increase revenue.

## Technologies
- **Big Data Frameworks:** Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Hadoop
- **Programming Languages:** Java, Python
- **Database and Storage:** Hive, HDFS
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Elasticsearch Kibana
- **Containerization and Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **Version Control:** Git

## Key Features
1. **Data Ingestion Layer with Apache Kafka:**
   - Captured real-time data from multiple sources, including clickstreams, transaction logs, and customer feedback, using Kafka producers.
   - Configured Kafka consumers for fault-tolerant and scalable data distribution to downstream systems.

2. **Real-Time Processing with Apache Spark:**
   - Built Spark Streaming jobs for near real-time data processing with low latency.
   - Developed machine learning models for customer churn prediction and product recommendations using Spark MLlib.

3. **Efficient Data Storage and Querying:**
   - Designed a hybrid storage system using Hadoop HDFS for raw data and Hive for structured queries.
   - Implemented partitioning and indexing for faster query performance.

4. **Data Visualization and Analytics Dashboards:**
   - Created Tableau and Kibana dashboards for visualizing customer retention, product performance, and marketing campaign effectiveness.
   - Enabled drill-down capabilities for granular analysis.

5. **Scalable Deployment:**
   - Containerized the pipeline using Docker and deployed on Kubernetes for high scalability.
   - Configured Kubernetes auto-scaling and integrated monitoring tools like Prometheus.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Configure Kafka and Spark streaming settings in the environment configuration files.
3. Deploy Docker containers and start services using Kubernetes.
4. Connect Tableau and Kibana to the pipeline for visualization.

## Outcomes
- Achieved real-time data processing with an end-to-end latency of less than **5 seconds**.
- Improved marketing campaign success rates by **30%**.
- Enhanced system scalability, handling over **1 million events per second** during peak loads.
- Reduced data processing costs by **20%** through optimized storage and computation strategies.
